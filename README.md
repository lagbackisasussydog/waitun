# Waitun

The most simple blox fruits auto mastery farm script

don't complain why it's bad

But anyways, this script is open-source so feel free to skid

---

Here's the script: 

``` lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lagbackisasussydog/waitun/refs/heads/main/mastery.lua"))()
```

---

(don't mind me if i lied cuz i already tell you)

CHANGELOGS:
````
=> Developing on a script hub (i will add kaitun i promise)

=> No more hiccup
````
